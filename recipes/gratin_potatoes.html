        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These au gratin potatoes are my husband's favorite â€” 
            he considers it a special occasion every time I make them! 
            The creamy cheese sauce and tender potatoes in this classic 
            French dish make a delicious flavor combination. Serve potatoes 
            au gratin with a roast pork loin or beef tenderloin, alongside a green salad.</p>
        <p>There's nothing like au gratin potatoes to take any meal over the top. 
            The creamy, decadent, and oh-so satisfying recipe is sure to please 
            everyone at your table.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Potatoes:</strong> This recipe starts with thinly sliced Russet potatoes. You can substitute Yukon gold, if you like.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion:</strong>  Slice one onion into rings to layer with the potatoes.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong>  These creamy au gratin potatoes are simply seasoned with just salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter and flour:</strong>  The cheese sauce starts with a roux made with butter and all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk:</strong>  Make sure you slowly whisk in the milk to create the creamiest consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese:</strong>  Because isn't everything better with shredded Cheddar?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Make Au Gratin Potatoes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Assemble the casserole:</strong> Layer half of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Season. Layer onion slices over top, then top with remaining potatoes. Season again.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong>  Melt the butter in a saucepan. Gradually whisk in flour and salt and cook for about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the milk. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened. Stir in the cheese.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the casserole:</strong>  Pour the sauce over the potatoes. Cover the dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are tender and the sauce is bubbling.</li>
